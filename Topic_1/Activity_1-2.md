# ACTIVITY 1.2


1.  Which array initialization will assign odd numbers from 1 to 5 to an array named Odd?

    (Note: Any integer that cannot be divided exactly by 2 is an odd number.)

    *A. `int Odd [3] = {1, 3, 5};`*

    B. `int Odd [5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`

    C. `int Odd [5] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};`


2.  An array called Height has five values and is initialized with the values as below.

      `float Height[ ] = {1.2, 1.45, 1.3, 1.55, 1.4};`

    Why is the array size not written?
    
    A. The array size is necessary to be written for all array declarations but this declaration is invalid.

    B. The array size is flexible based on the memory allocations given to the array at run-time.

    *C. When declaring arrays using initial values list, it is not necessary to write the array size.*
